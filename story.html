				<p> Do me a solid started off as the frustrations of a tourist
					in a foreign town. Every day there are millions of travellers
					all across the globe who are in the same situation of just
					needing a bit of help with something. There are plenty of 
					services out there that can help but they cost an arm and a 
					leg to hire, not to mention the hardest part - looking who to 
					find
				</p>
				<p> Hiring services such as photographers or interpreters can be 
					a costly process - both in time and money. You'll need to know
					agencies in the area, which ones have the best deals, and most
					importantly if you can trust them or not. Even if you were willing
					to do all this, why would you hire a professional photographer 
					just to follow you around for a day or two to take photos of you
					on a holiday?
				</p>
				<p> So what if you could just get someone to come down for a little
					bit and help you out in exchange for a tip of sorts. Someone to
					pop on by and "Do you a solid" and be recognised for their effort? 
					And because this someone isn't a world class photographer or 
					interpreter with more degrees than a thermometer - it won't cost you
					your trip and then some.
